- 👋 Hi, I’m @lopperman, also known on Reddit as u/ITFuture.  You can call me Paul. 
- I used to be a C# Dev.  I now manage delivery of software by keeping the team members happy, and delivering early and often to the clients. 
- 👀 I’d picked up VBA about two years ago. I'm very impressed with the language. Check out some of the fully functional demos with source in my just-VBA project. 
- 🌱 I’m currently Power Apps for fun, and alsready built an app at work. 
- 💞️ I’m interested in someone to collaborate with me on my 'CopyRight' VBA library. 
- 📫 How to reach me drop a comment here somewhere or DM ITFuture on Reddit
