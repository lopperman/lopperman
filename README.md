Hi, Iâ€™m Paul Brower - @lopperman on GitHub, u/ITFuture on Reddit.
Short Bio:
 - Formerly paid as a developer (mostly C#). No longer paid to write code, but I still do it and enjoy it
 - Work now as a Delivery Lead for https://www.wwt.com/ 
 - Started looking at VBA in 2020 - curiosity to see what could be built with 'that old thing' - ended up writing 90,000 lines of code for a custom tool that's been used at work since 2020
 - **100% of all custom code in my just-VBA library is both PC and Mac compatible.**
- ðŸ‘€ Check out some of the fully functional demos with source in my just-VBA project. 
- Frequent contributor to /r/VBA https://www.reddit.com/user/ITFuture/submitted/
