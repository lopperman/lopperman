#### Short Bio:

 - Formerly paid as a developer (mostly C#). No longer paid to write code, but I still do it and enjoy it
 - Work now as a Delivery Lead for [World Wide Technology](https://www.wwt.com/)
 - Started looking at VBA in 2020 - it's turned into a morbid curiosity now, seeing how far it can be pushed.

#### VBA CONTRIBUTIONS

 - 100% of all code in my [just-VBA](https://github.com/lopperman/just-VBA) library is both PC and Mac compatible. (ðŸ‘€ Check out some of the fully functional demos with source in my just-VBA project)
