Hi, I’m Paul Brower - @lopperman on GitHub, u/ITFuture on Reddit.
Short Bio:
 - C# Developer for 20 years
 - Work now as a Delivery Lead for @WWT
 - Started looking at VBA in 2020 - curiosity to see what type of commercial tool could be built with 'that old thing' - ended up building a tool that's been used at work for over 2 years.
- 👀 Check out some of the fully functional demos with source in my just-VBA project. 
- Frequent contributor to /r/VBA https://www.reddit.com/user/ITFuture/submitted/
- 🌱 I’m experimenting with Power Apps for fun, and already built a canvas app at work. 
- 💞️ I’m interested in someone to collaborate with me on my 'CopyRight' VBA library.
